//! # Channel
//!
//! A unidirectional payment channel contract for Soroban (Stellar).
//!
//! A payment channel allows a funder to make many small payments to a recipient
//! off-chain, with only two on-chain transactions: opening the channel and
//! closing it. This avoids per-payment transaction fees and latency.
//!
//! > [!WARNING]
//! > **The contracts in this repository have not been audited.**
//!
//! ## Participants
//!
//! - **Funder (`from`)**: Deposits tokens into the channel and signs
//!   commitments authorizing the recipient to close the channel and receive a
//!   given amount.
//! - **Recipient (`to`)**: Receives commitments off-chain and can close the
//!   channel on-chain at any time using a signed commitment.
//!
//! ## Expectations
//!
//! Participants have the following responsibilities to receive the funds owing
//! to them.
//!
//! ### Funder
//!
//! - Keeping the private key corresponding to `commitment_key` (the commitment signing key) secret.
//!
//! ### Recipient
//!
//! - Verifies the `refund_waiting_period` at channel creation is long
//!   enough to allow them to react to a close_start event.
//! - Verifies the `amount` in each commitment is less than the channels
//!   balance.
//! - Monitors the channel for [`event::Close`] events.
//! - Calls `close` with a commitment promptly after seeing a close_start
//!   event, before the refund waiting period elapses.
//!

//! ```mermaid
//! stateDiagram-v2
//!     [*] --> Open: __constructor
//!     Open --> Closed: close
//!     Open --> Closing: close_start
//!     Closing --> Closed: close
//!     Closing --> Closed: [after wait]

//!
//! `top_up` can be called in any state. `close` can only be called before
//! the channel is closed.
//!
//! ## Functions
//!
//! ### Lifecycle
//!
//! | Function | Description |
//! |---|---|
//! | `__constructor` | Open a channel with an initial deposit. Callable by the funder, or anyone if amount is zero. |
//! | `top_up` | Deposit additional tokens into the channel. |
//! | `close` | Close the channel using a signed commitment, withdrawing funds to the recipient. Automatically attempts to refund the funder. |
//! | `close_start` | Begin closing the channel, effective after a waiting period. |
//! | `refund` | Refund the remaining balance to the funder after the close is effective. |
//!
//! ### Helpers
//!
//! | Function | Description |
//! |---|---|
//! | `prepare_commitment` | Generate the commitment bytes to sign. |
//!
//! ### Getters
//!
//! | Function | Description |
//! |---|---|
//! | `token` | Returns the token address. |
//! | `from` | Returns the funder address. |
//! | `to` | Returns the recipient address. |
//! | `refund_waiting_period` | Returns the refund waiting period in ledgers. |
//! | `balance` | Returns the current balance. |
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! ### 1. Open
//!
//! The channel is deployed with a SEP-41 token, funder address, recipient
//! address, an ed25519 `commitment_key` (public key), an initial deposit
//! amount, and a `refund_waiting_period` (in ledgers).
//!
//! The funder's tokens are transferred into the channel contract on deployment.
//! The funder can also top up the channel later using [`Contract::top_up`], or
//! by transferring the token directly to the channel contract address.
//!
//! ### 2. Off-chain payments
//!
//! The funder makes payments by signing commitments off-chain and sending them
//! to the recipient. A commitment authorizes the recipient to close the
//! channel and receive the specified amount.
//!
//! For example:
//! - Commitment for 100: recipient can close the channel and receive 100.
//! - Commitment for 140: recipient can close the channel and receive 140.
//!
//! A commitment is an XDR serialized [`Commitment`] struct containing a domain
//! separator (`chancmmt`), the network ID, the channel contract address, and
//! the amount. The
//! funder signs the serialized bytes with the ed25519 key corresponding to the
//! `commitment_key`. Use [`Contract::prepare_commitment`] as a convenience to
//! generate the bytes to sign.
//!
//! The serialized commitment is an XDR `ScVal::Map` with four entries
//! (sorted alphabetically by key):
//!
//! ```text
//! ScVal::Map({
//!     Symbol("amount"):  I128(amount),
//!     Symbol("channel"): Address(channel_contract_address),
//!     Symbol("domain"):  Symbol("chancmmt"),
//!     Symbol("network"): BytesN<32>(network_id),
//! })
//! ```
//!
//! ### 3. Close
//!
//! The recipient calls [`Contract::close`] with a commitment amount and its
//! signature before the close effective ledger is reached. The contract
//! verifies the signature, then transfers the commitment amount to the
//! recipient.
//!
//! After transferring the committed funds, the close function automatically
//! attempts to refund the remaining balance to the funder. This refund attempt
//! uses `try_transfer` and will silently succeed or fail without affecting the
//! withdrawal. If the automatic refund fails, the funder can call
//! [`Contract::refund`] to reclaim the remaining balance.
//!
//! Cannot be called after the close effective ledger has been reached
//! (i.e. after a `close_start` waiting period has elapsed).
//!
//! ### 4. Close Start
//!
//! The funder calls [`Contract::close_start`] to begin closing the channel.
//! The close does not take effect immediately — there is a waiting period of
//! `refund_waiting_period` ledgers.
//!
//! The recipient can still call [`Contract::close`] during the waiting
//! period. Once the waiting period has elapsed, the recipient can no longer
//! call `close`, and the funder can call `refund` to reclaim the remaining
//! balance.
//!
//! **Important:** The recipient should monitor for [`event::Close`] events and
//! close before the close_start becomes effective.
//!
//! ### 5. Refund
//!
//! After the refund waiting period has elapsed, the funder calls
//! [`Contract::refund`] to reclaim whatever balance remains in the channel.
//! This transfers the **entire** remaining token balance to the funder,
//! including any amount the recipient was entitled to but did not close for.
//! The contract does not reserve funds for the recipient. If the recipient
//! has not closed before the funder calls refund, those funds are lost to
//! the recipient and assumed to be of no interest to the recipient.
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! - Commitments are signed with an ed25519 key, not a Stellar account. The
//!   `commitment_key` is set at deployment and cannot be changed.
//! - The commitment includes a domain separator, the network ID, and the
//!   channel contract address, preventing signatures from being reused across
//!   networks, channels, or confused with other signed payloads.
//! - The refund waiting period protects the recipient: it gives them time to
//!   close using their latest commitment before the funder can reclaim
//!   funds.
