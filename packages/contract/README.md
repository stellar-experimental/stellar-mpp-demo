# Channel

A unidirectional payment channel contract for Soroban (Stellar).

A payment channel allows a funder to make many small payments to a recipient
off-chain, with only two on-chain transactions: opening the channel and
closing it. This avoids per-payment transaction fees and latency.

> [!WARNING]
> **The contracts in this repository have not been audited.**

## Participants

- **Funder (`from`)**: Deposits tokens into the channel and signs
  commitments authorizing the recipient to close the channel and receive a
  given amount.
- **Recipient (`to`)**: Receives commitments off-chain and can close the
  channel on-chain at any time using a signed commitment.

## Expectations

Participants have the following responsibilities to receive the funds owing
to them.

### Funder

- Keeping the private key corresponding to `commitment_key` (the commitment signing key) secret.

### Recipient

- Verifies the `refund_waiting_period` at channel creation is long
  enough to allow them to react to a close_start event.
- Verifies the `amount` in each commitment is less than the channels
  balance.
- Monitors the channel for [`event::Close`] events.
- Calls `close` with a commitment promptly after seeing a close_start
  event, before the refund waiting period elapses.

    [*] --> Open: __constructor
    Open --> Closed: close
    Open --> Closing: close_start
    Closing --> Closed: close
    Closing --> Closed: [after wait]
    Closed --> [*]: refund
```

`top_up` can be called in any state. `close` can only be called before
the channel is closed.

## Functions

### Lifecycle

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `__constructor` | Open a channel with an initial deposit. Callable by the funder, or anyone if amount is zero. |
| `top_up` | Deposit additional tokens into the channel. |
| `close` | Close the channel using a signed commitment, withdrawing funds to the recipient. Automatically attempts to refund the funder. |
| `close_start` | Begin closing the channel, effective after a waiting period. |
| `refund` | Refund the remaining balance to the funder after the close is effective. |

### Helpers

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `prepare_commitment` | Generate the commitment bytes to sign. |

### Getters

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `token` | Returns the token address. |
| `from` | Returns the funder address. |
| `to` | Returns the recipient address. |
| `refund_waiting_period` | Returns the refund waiting period in ledgers. |
| `balance` | Returns the current balance. |

## Lifecycle

### 1. Open

The channel is deployed with a SEP-41 token, funder address, recipient
address, an ed25519 `commitment_key` (public key), an initial deposit
amount, and a `refund_waiting_period` (in ledgers).

The funder's tokens are transferred into the channel contract on deployment.
The funder can also top up the channel later using [`Contract::top_up`], or
by transferring the token directly to the channel contract address.

### 2. Off-chain payments

The funder makes payments by signing commitments off-chain and sending them
to the recipient. A commitment authorizes the recipient to close the
channel and receive the specified amount.

For example:
- Commitment for 100: recipient can close the channel and receive 100.
- Commitment for 140: recipient can close the channel and receive 140.

A commitment is an XDR serialized [`Commitment`] struct containing a domain
separator (`chancmmt`), the network ID, the channel contract address, and
the amount. The
funder signs the serialized bytes with the ed25519 key corresponding to the
`commitment_key`. Use [`Contract::prepare_commitment`] as a convenience to
generate the bytes to sign.

The serialized commitment is an XDR `ScVal::Map` with four entries
(sorted alphabetically by key):

```text
ScVal::Map({
    Symbol("amount"):  I128(amount),
    Symbol("channel"): Address(channel_contract_address),
    Symbol("domain"):  Symbol("chancmmt"),
    Symbol("network"): BytesN<32>(network_id),
})
```

### 3. Close

The recipient calls [`Contract::close`] with a commitment amount and its
signature before the close effective ledger is reached. The contract
verifies the signature, then transfers the commitment amount to the
recipient.

After transferring the committed funds, the close function automatically
attempts to refund the remaining balance to the funder. This refund attempt
uses `try_transfer` and will silently succeed or fail without affecting the
withdrawal. If the automatic refund fails, the funder can call
[`Contract::refund`] to reclaim the remaining balance.

Cannot be called after the close effective ledger has been reached
(i.e. after a `close_start` waiting period has elapsed).

### 4. Close Start

The funder calls [`Contract::close_start`] to begin closing the channel.
The close does not take effect immediately — there is a waiting period of
`refund_waiting_period` ledgers.

The recipient can still call [`Contract::close`] during the waiting
period. Once the waiting period has elapsed, the recipient can no longer
call `close`, and the funder can call `refund` to reclaim the remaining
balance.

**Important:** The recipient should monitor for [`event::Close`] events and
close before the close_start becomes effective.

### 5. Refund

After the refund waiting period has elapsed, the funder calls
[`Contract::refund`] to reclaim whatever balance remains in the channel.
This transfers the **entire** remaining token balance to the funder,
including any amount the recipient was entitled to but did not close for.
The contract does not reserve funds for the recipient. If the recipient
has not closed before the funder calls refund, those funds are lost to
the recipient and assumed to be of no interest to the recipient.

## Security

- Commitments are signed with an ed25519 key, not a Stellar account. The
  `commitment_key` is set at deployment and cannot be changed.
- The commitment includes a domain separator, the network ID, and the
  channel contract address, preventing signatures from being reused across
  networks, channels, or confused with other signed payloads.
- The refund waiting period protects the recipient: it gives them time to
  close using their latest commitment before the funder can reclaim
  funds.

# Channel Factory

A factory contract for opening channel contracts on Soroban (Stellar).

The factory stores a channel contract wasm hash and opens new channel
instances using it. An admin can update the wasm hash to open newer
versions of the channel contract.

## Functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `__constructor` | Initialize the factory with an admin and channel wasm hash. |
| `set_wasm` | Update the stored channel wasm hash. Admin only. |
| `open` | Deploy a new channel contract with the given parameters. |
| `admin` | Returns the admin address. |
| `wasm_hash` | Returns the stored channel wasm hash. |
